## Build Timeline

### Month 1: Procurement & Setup
- Order all components
- Set up workspace and safety systems
- Design and print hull components
- Prepare assembly fixtures

### Month 2: Assembly
- Wind electromagnetic coils
- Assemble power and control systems
- Hull assembly and coating
- Initial component testing

### Month 3: Integration & Testing
- Full system integration
- Safety system verification
- Initial proof-of-concept tests
- Performance optimization

### Month 4: Validation
- Measurement protocol development
- Repeatability testing
- Documentation and analysis
- Phase 2 planning

## Risk Mitigation

### Component Substitutions
- **Graphene-PLA**: Standard PLA+ with graphene coating if unavailable
- **Super Caps**: Multiple smaller capacitors in parallel if large ones unavailable
- **High-speed camera**: Smartphone high-speed mode for initial tests

### Backup Plans
- **Power issues**: Start with lower energy (100J) tests
- **Measurement precision**: Use multiple measurement methods for validation
- **Safety concerns**: Remote operation from separate building

## Next Actions

1. **Confirm budget allocation** - Which tier are we targeting?
2. **Verify workspace requirements** - Do you have adequate power and space?
3. **Start critical path procurement** - Graphene-PLA and capacitors first
4. **Safety planning** - Local regulations and permits needed?

Ready to start ordering? Which components should we prioritize first?
